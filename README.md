Create **FilesCollections** with **GridFS** storage. Lightweight. Simple.

With this package you can easily create multiple **`ostrio:files`** collections (FilesCollections) that work with [MongoDB's
GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/) system **out-of-the-box**.
 
It can be a real hassle to introduce gridFS as storage to your project. 
This package aims to abstract common logic into an easy and accessible API while ensuring to let you override anything in case
you need a fine-tuned custom behavior.

The abtract factory allows you to create configurations on a higher level that apply to all your FilesCollections,
while you still can fine-tune on the collection level. Supports all constructor arguments of FilesCollection.
 
## Why such a specialized package?

This package is designed for projects, that can't rely on third-party storages, because one or more of the following
applies:

- there are concerns about privacy or security when using a third party storage
- the application has to be shipped in a "all-in-one" monolith
- the app is intended for intranet use and connection to the "outside" is prohibited
- whatever you can think of....

The use case may be not very common (Meteor + `ostrio:files` + GridFS) but if it's for you, 
this package makes file handling much easier and consistent.

### What is covered / what is not (yet)

This package has some out-of-the-box functionality that covers the following points

#### Creation

- [ x ] Creating new `FilesCollection` instances
- [ x ] Supporting full `FilesCollection` constructor
- [ x ] Allows to override package internals by explicitly passing the hooks (`onAfterUpload` etc.)
- [ x ] Code-splitting (server/client)
- [ x ] Using GridFS buckets instead of deprecated `gridfs-stream`
- [ x ] Adapter for translation
- [ x ] Creating new `FilesCollection` instances

#### `onBeforeUpload`

This package has some some default behavior defined for the `onBeforeUpload` hook. 
You can override it completely or hook into it's behavior using the following parameters:

- [ x ] check file size via `maxSize` (Number)
- [ x ] check file extensions via `extensions` ([String])
- [ x ] check permissions via `validateUser` (Function)
- [ x ] check permissions via `validateUser` (Function)

#### `onAfterUpload`

The default behavior for `onAfterUpload` is to check the mime of the uploaded file and move it to the Grid.
Hoever, you can hook into this process, too:

- [ x ] validate user via `validateUser` (Function)
- [ x ] validate mime via `validateMime` (Function)
- [ x ] transform additional versions (e.g. thumbnails, converted videos, etc.) via `transformVersions` (Function)

#### `protected`

- [ x ] validate user via `validateUser` (Function)

#### `interceptDownload`

- [ x ] falls back to find a valid version, if request to a non-existent version fails
- [ x ] streams the file from the GridFS bucket
- [ x ] handles errors with an error response
- [ x ] sets the correct content disposition, depending on `download` query attribute

#### `onBeforeRemove`

- [ x ] validate user via `validateUser` (Function)

#### `afterRemove`

- [ x ] removes file, including all versions, from the GridFS and the FilesCollection


## Getting started

Install this package via

```bash
$ meteor add leaonline:files-collection-factory
```

The package exports different APIs for client and server but you import it the same way on server and client:

```javascript
import { createGridFilesFactory } from 'meteor/leaonline:grid-factory'
```

From here you have to consider the [FilesCollection architecture](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/constructor.md)
in order to manage access, post processing, removal etc.

## Server side

On the server side you can use the following abstract factory api:

```javascript
({
  i18nFactory: Function, // translator function, str => translatedStr
  fs: Object, // the node file-system module
  bucketFactory: Function, // a function that returns a gridFS bucket
  defaultBucket: String, // a default name for the bucket to be used
  createObjectId: Function, // a function that creates an Object Id by a given GridFS id
  debug: Boolean
}) => Function
```

### Minimal example

The following example shows a minimal abstract GridFactory:

```javascript
import { MongoInternals } from 'meteor/mongo'
import { createGridFactory } from 'meteor/leaonline:grid-factory'
import { i18n } from '/path/to/i8n'
import fs from 'fs'

const debug = Meteor.isDevelopment
const i18nFactory = (...args) => i18n.get(...args)
const createObjectId = ({ gridFsFileId }) => new MongoInternals.NpmModule.ObjectID(gridFsFileId)
const bucketFactory = bucketName => 
  new MongoInternals.NpmModule.GridFSBucket(MongoInternals.defaultRemoteCollectionDriver().mongo.db, { bucketName })

const createFilesCollection = createGridFilesFactory({ i18nFactory, fs, bucketFactory, createObjectId, debug })
```
